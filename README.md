The book contains a lot of errors and typos in both the text and the code, especially the [OCR scanned PDF](http://8bs.com/othrdnld/manuals/publication/Making_Music_on_the_BBC_Computer_Waugh.zip) on [8bs.com - publications](http://8bs.com/othrdnld/manuals/publications.shtml) which has additional OCR induced errors. The listings in this repository have, for the most part, been checked, run and corrected. 

**Note**: Listing 5.2 is incomplete due to omission in the book.
