BASIC listings from the book, *Making music on the BBC computer* by Ian Waugh

There is a thread about this book on StarDot.org.uk, [Making Music on the BBC Computer by Ian Waugh](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4923).

## Links to the book

The book is available online:

- [OCR scanned PDF](http://8bs.com/othrdnld/manuals/publication/Making_Music_on_the_BBC_Computer_Waugh.zip) on [8bs.com - publications](http://8bs.com/othrdnld/manuals/publications.shtml)
- A bitmap scanned PDF on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/makingmusiconbbc0000waug) - free account required for a digital "loan"

The book contains a lot of errors and typos in both the text and the code, especially the [OCR scanned PDF](http://8bs.com/othrdnld/manuals/publication/Making_Music_on_the_BBC_Computer_Waugh.zip) on [8bs.com - publications](http://8bs.com/othrdnld/manuals/publications.shtml) which has additional OCR induced errors. 

**Note**: Listing 5.2 is incomplete due to a listing truncation in the book (see **Errors in listing 5.2** below).

The listings in this repository have, for the most part, been checked, run and corrected. 

## Disk images

Disk images of the code listings are available:
- A DSD is contained within [making_music.zip](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/download/file.php?id=3321&sid=1cd77dd3853fad707f262f788a0b93b4), from [this post](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=44849&sid=1cd77dd3853fad707f262f788a0b93b4#p44849) on the stardot.org.uk forum.
  - ***NOTE**: this DSD contains errors in listing 5.2 carried over from the listing truncation and omissions in the book, as well as other additional errors (i.e. line 2330) introduced by the manual code entry*.
  
- Another couple of SSD images are available within the [ZIP file](http://8bs.com/othrdnld/manuals/publication/Making_Music_on_the_BBC_Computer_Waugh.zip) containing the OCR scan of the book on [8bs.com - publications](http://8bs.com/othrdnld/manuals/publications.shtml). The SSD, `SIDE0.SSD` has a complete listing 5.2, although this listing still contains some errors (see **Errors in listing 5.2** below):
  - Line 2310 
  - The `ON x GOTO` error, requiring the patch for lines 2420 and 2485
